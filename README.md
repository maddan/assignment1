# AngularCalculator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Technologies used

Angular CLI
Typescript
Angular Framework
SCSS for styling using Flex

Angular framework was used because you can easily generate an Angular project using Angular CLI commands. With few lines of commands, you can create an app and run using your dev server. Since this exercise focuss more on CSS styling, I used SCSS for styling using flexbox container to demonstrate that the div section can be containerized and segreate each section within their container. The whole calculator resides inside the main container and the display and input buttons resides in the sub container.
